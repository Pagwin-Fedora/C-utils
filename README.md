# this is the git repo for standard stuff I use in C
checkout the branch that you need at this moment future me

note this isn't me rewritting the standard library for C I'm just adding other stuff I think I'll find usefull in the future here in such a manner that any branch of this repo can work independantly(but in some cases with) other branches
